# YouTube API Endpoint Migration

## Overview
The YouTube API endpoints have been consolidated into the main application server. Previously, these endpoints were served by a separate server in `backend/server.js` running on port 3010. This change simplifies the application architecture and reduces the number of servers needed.

## Changes Made

1. Updated frontend components to use relative API URLs:
   - In `src/components/domain-detail/DomainYoutube.jsx`: Changed from `http://localhost:3010/api/youtube/${domain.domainId}` to `/api/youtube/${domain.domainId}`
   - In `src/components/domain-detail/DomainDetailPage.jsx`: Made the same URL change for the YouTube data check

2. Added note in main server.js explaining that YouTube endpoints are now served by the main server

3. Deleted the redundant `backend/server.js` file that was previously running on port 3010

## Benefits

- Simplified architecture with all endpoints served from a single server
- Eliminated the need to run and maintain an additional server
- Improved deployment efficiency
- Better frontend URL consistency using relative paths

## Technical Implementation

The YouTube routes are mounted in the main server.js file without authentication middleware:

```javascript
// Mount YouTube routes separately to avoid auth middleware
app.use('/api/youtube', youtubeRoutes);
```

This ensures that YouTube API endpoints remain accessible without requiring the authentication that other API endpoints use.
